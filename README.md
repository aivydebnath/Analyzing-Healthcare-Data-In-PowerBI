# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-In-PowerBI

## Objective

Improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority in healthcare. I aim to identify hospital performance outliers and determine the key attributes influencing the length of stay and cost per patient discharge. This Power BI project will explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat.

## Data

The dataset used in this case study includes information on patient demographics(various areas/regions), diagnoses, procedures, and length of stay (LOS). The data is aggregated at the hospital level so that we can compare the performance of different hospitals.

## Analysis

The project is to analyze the data and identify factors that impact patient LOS and cost. I have looked for differences in efficiency between different hospitals.

## Visualization

I have created a variety of visualizations to communicate our insights to the HealthStat team. These visualizations will include charts and tables and have segregated based on cost, length of stay, and hospital profile.

## Dashboard

This dashboard brings all the insights together. This will allow the HealthStat team or anyone to easily track hospital performance and the factors that most influence length of stay and cost per patient discharge.
