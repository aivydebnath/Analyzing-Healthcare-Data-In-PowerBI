# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-In-PowerBI

## Objective

Improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority in healthcare. I aim to identify hospital performance outliers and determine the key attributes influencing the length of stay and cost per patient discharge. This Power BI project will explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat.

## Data

The dataset used in this case study includes information on patient demographics(various areas/regions), diagnoses, procedures, and length of stay (LOS). The data is aggregated at the hospital level so that we can compare the performance of different hospitals.

## Analysis

The project is to analyze the data and identify factors that impact patient LOS and cost. I have looked for differences in efficiency between different hospitals.

### Home:
We have data on almost all the hospitals present in New York. This page shows the names of the three dashboards we have created.

### LOS Comparison:

This dashboard provides a detailed comparison of the Length of Stay (LOS) in a hospital. It highlights key influencers affecting the average LOS, the top segments with the highest and lowest LOS days, and a comparative graph of the average LOS for the top 15 hospitals. This data visualization aids in understanding and optimizing patient care duration.

### Cost Comparison:

This dashboard provides a comprehensive cost comparison for a hospital. It includes key influencers affecting the average cost per discharge, the average length of stay (LOS) for patients, and the highest and lowest average cost per discharge. This data-driven approach aids in understanding and optimizing hospital performance.

### Hospital Profile:

This dashboard presents a comprehensive profile of a hospital. It includes metrics such as the average Length of Stay (LOS) and average LOS by diagnosis, total discharges by severity of illness and diagnosis description, and the average cost per discharge. This data provides valuable insights into the hospitalâ€™s performance and patient care efficiency.

## Visualization

I have created a variety of visualizations to communicate our insights to the HealthStat team. These visualizations will include charts and tables and be segregated based on cost, length of stay, and hospital profile.

## Dashboard

This dashboard brings all the insights together. This will allow the HealthStat team or anyone to easily track hospital performance and the factors that most influence length of stay and cost per patient discharge.
