# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-In-PowerBI

Introduction

In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. This Power BI case study will explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat.

Data

The dataset used in this case study includes information on patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and length of stay (LOS). The data is aggregated at the hospital level, so we can compare the performance of different hospitals.

Analysis

We will use Power BI to analyze the data and identify factors that impact patient LOS and cost. We will also look for differences in efficiency between different hospitals.

Visualization

We will create a variety of visualizations to communicate our insights to the HealthStat team. These visualizations will include maps, charts, and tables.

Dashboard

Finally, we will create a sophisticated business dashboard that brings all of our insights together. This dashboard will allow the HealthStat team to easily track hospital performance and identify areas for improvement.
